NAME
    Kwiki::URLBlock - Blocks edit based on added URLs

DESCRIPTION
    It blocks an edit if you add too many URLs or if you enter a blacklisted
    one.

  Configuration
    The default config variables that you can override in config.yaml are:

     urlblock_max_allowed: 3
     urlblock_blacklist:

    urlblock_blacklist is a path to a blacklist file.

    The syntax is a list of newline separated regexps. Anything after # is
    treated as a comment. Whitespace is ignored.

    Example taken from <http://wiki.mozilla.org/wiki/Spam_blacklist>:

     # some known "bad" domains
     ltjz2000\.com
     ticketsmyway\.com
     emmss\.com
     [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]*\.com # 5 or more character numeric .coms
     # some words frequently used by spammers in urls
